During our vacation I started Canicross training with our dog, Birdo, again. I'd like to share the progress on this
blog, to
sort out my thoughts and the training goals better. This is an experience report and **not** a best practice
documentation or advice on how to do Canicross training with your dog.

## What is Canicross?

Canicross is a running sport you can do with your dog, kind of sled-dog-training, but for runners. The goal is that your
dog will pull you forward while running. For this you will need a little bit of equipment for the sport to be safe.
Ideally you will teach basic commands to your dog, e.g. for running faster, slower, turning right or left, going
straight ahead or stopping. This is necessary, because depending on the length of the leash your dog will be 2m ahead of
you.

## Equipment

### Harness

The most important piece of equipment for the safety of the dog is the running harness. It should fit extremely well and
distribute the pressure while pulling across the front of the chest. If you imitate the pull of the leash, which pulls
backwards and slightly upwards, the harness should put no pressure whatsoever on the neck or throat. This way, the dog
can pull without hurting itself. We received our harness from the shop of Uwe Radant, and they were very helpful with
any of our questions.

### Belt

Altough it looks like a piece of clothing you would get in a fetish store, having the proper belt for Canicross is also
important. It distributes the pressure of the pulling dog evenly on the hip, in the mass center of the body. This way it
does not hurt the runners back or trips them, if the dog is pulling forward. The belt is padded on the hip-part and has
some additional straps to prevent it from slipping upwards. Unfortunately it only works with tight pants, no lose fit
allowed. Great bonus: It has pockets!

### Leash

The leash has to be flexible, so neither the runner nor the dog experience the motions as a shock. If the dog starts
pulling or the runner starts slowing down, the shock is absorbed, which is better for both their bodies and does not
startle the dog. As the leash is very flexible, it is not suited well to restraint the dog.

In the picture you can also see the emergency release: The runner tethers themselves to a fast, strong
and often heavy animal for this sport. In an emergency, e.g. the dog being hit and dragged by a car (let's hope it never
comes to this) it can be important that the runner can immediately release themselves from the dog. In this case, they
could pull on the orange string and immediately open the release which holds the leash.

## Challenges for Birdo

Birdo is what one would describe as a reactive dog. She never showed any aggression towards humans or dogs, but she is
very easily excited and easily distracted. The goal of Canicross training is that the dog ignores external stimuli as
other dogs, people or interesting smells. Its job is to pull the runner, and nothing else. While this is working
surprisingly well for us during our first training sessions, there is still a long way until it would work over a longer
timespan. Our dog trainer also recommended not to do long runs with Birdo, as she has to learn to focus on me better.
This is one reason why we start out with short and versatile runs, where I often change the speed, find a lot of
crossings to go left or right. This way she needs to focus more, instead of running straight ahead for 10 minutes with
no change. My goal is to increase the running-parts after some time, so she has to keep her focus for longer.

Birdo does not have any challenges running fast or running for a longer time at all. Dalmatians were bred for running,
and she is no exception, although she is a small Dalmatian with ~20kg. I used to go on "normal" runs with her, and our
longest was 15km with an altitude of 250m.

## Challenges for Me

I consider myself to be a slow, but somewhat enduring runner. When I was in better shape I managed to run half-marathons
in roughly 2:10h. The hardest one included a climb of 550m, with a total time of 2:25. I often tried to integrate faster
runs into my training, but my pulse always rises very fast if I try to up the tempo. My best 5k time was around 24:
30m. This is not entirely comparable, as I realized during some Canicross trainings with Birdo last year that I need
one minute less per km if Birdo really pulls me.

For Birdo to reliably pull me, she has to enter a running gait. As already mentioned, Dalmatians are fast, so I need a
pace of ~5 minutes per km for this to work, which would almost beat my all-time 5k record. This is another reason to
start the training with intervals and short bursts. This way I can variate between fast paces where Birdo pulls me
forward and slower paces where I recover and Birdo needs to contain herself while focussing on me. Also, this will
protect my joints for a start, as her pulling me makes me run faster than my body is used to.

## Prospect

During our vacation, I managed to run with Birdo on three different occasions. Every of those runs went better than the
one before, so I will stick with the plan of doing short intervals with a bigger variety. I don't know if I would ever
be in the position to constantly run a 5k race with her, let alone with other dogs. I see this as a fun activity I can
do with my dog, which might also benefit my running form if done correctly and help her learn to focus better.
