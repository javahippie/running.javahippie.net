Hey, I'm Tim, and I am a guy living in Freiburg, Germany, with my wife, our small son and our dog.
You can find my tech blog at [https://javahippie.net](https://javahippie.net). I created this blog to
have a non-tech topic to write about, and to motivate myself by thinking about runnin in a more structured way.

I consider myself a slow runner, I have managed to finish some half-marathon distances in ~2:15h. I prefer running
trails without time pressure. The thing I enjoy most about running is the time off without distractions, being alone
with myself.

I am currently getting back into shape after a pause of ~2 months after a longer non-serious illness. I also want to
start canicross training with our three-year-old Dalmatian Birdo again, so this is probably the topic I will start
writing about.
